# Sentiment Analysis on YouTube Comments Using KNN, Logistic Regression, and Naïve Bayes

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on YouTube comments using three different machine learning models:  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**  
- **Naïve Bayes (NB)**  

The goal is to classify comments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, analyzing their sentiment using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
